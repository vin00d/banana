# banana only recently (2022-11-15) added custom build commands,
#  including the addition of secrets via `ARG/--build-arg`,
#  so we've split the build into two separate Dockerfiles,
#  where the first uses a custom build command and the second
#  builds on top of it.
# This is the second file, which is sent to banana to build.
